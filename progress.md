Original prompt: separate Tetris into E:\Proj\Game-1-tetris, diagnose the mixed Temple/Tetris history and local QA copies, then correct the tiny and overlapping Tetris presentation without changing accepted game rules.

## 2026-07-15

- Created standalone Tetris repository and retained QA clones under `.local/qa-archives`.
- Isolated stale pre-V1 `dist` outside the active repository.
- Confirmed `4c85828` is the last pure Tetris integration point; later commits are docs-only coordination changes.
- Confirmed the screenshots use the accepted V1 source, not an alternate version.
- Root cause: 718 px shell cap, 306 px board cap, 174 px three-mode rail, and five controls forced into 306 px.
- Implemented the bounded T4 desktop layout recovery: 380 × 760 at 1440 × 900,
  460 × 920 at 2048 × 1152, complete Chinese mode labels, stacked control
  glyphs/labels, and the corrected pause-height ratio.
- Final local gates passed once: typecheck, 36-file/234-test Vitest, build, and a
  19-capture browser matrix under `docs/qa/evidence/tetris-t4/`.
- Active TODO: independent QA, coordinator changelog integration, and one push.
